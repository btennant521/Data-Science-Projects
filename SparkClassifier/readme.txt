Title: Classifier with Spark
Author: Ben Tennant

This is my first taste of machine learning on a distributed
platform. It is a simple decision tree classifier that 
uses social network data to decide if a user is likely
to make a purchase. This sort of model can be used to 
offer insight to marketers or sales-persons on whether or not
an individual is worth approaching with offers or
promotions.

Attributes:

User ID: integer value identifying a user

Gender: Male or Female

Age: integer

Estimated Salary: integer value estimation on the users salary

Purchased: 1 or 0, if the user purchased or did not purchase
