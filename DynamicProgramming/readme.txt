Title: Max Return on Investment
Author: Ben Tennant

This is a python program that computes which cities
would maximize return on a real estate investment.
The data contains the average real estate value 
for over 600 cities across America. We only consider
the change in price from the most recent 2 years. 
Given an amount, the program will compute the best
city/cities to invest in and how much your profit
would be. I believe this technique could be used to 
train a machine learning model to estimate stock changes.
